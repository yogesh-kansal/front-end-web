redux : {
actions have "type" property to define action, are plain js objects

reducer accepts state and action as argumnet and returns a next state
(prevState, action) => newState

store holds application state,  allows access via getState(), allows updation via dispatch(action),
resistors listeners by suscribe(listener) method

- combineReducers({objects}) combines multiple reducers.
